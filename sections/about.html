            Hey, My name is Raffi, I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for creativity, cool functionality and understanding why/how things work. 
I have been coding for around 6 months so far but have been focused on full-stack development for about 3 months now, I enjoy the process of having an idea and being able to make it come to life, coding allows me to do this on a day to day basis and allows me to push the extents of my creativity to new levels.<br /><br />
For most of my life, however, my coding knowledge was limited to a Year 7 Scratch lesson, and the main memory I have was being able to leave after it finished—I hated it! I grew up with a passion for sports, mainly football. I had a ball at my feet before I could walk, and spent the entirety of my childhood obsessing over the game I loved. This dream turned into a reality when I was scouted by Bolton Wanderers Academy at 6 years old, but to set the president of my life going forward wasn’t an easy achievement to get that first contract and achieve that goal. I was on trial for a whole 2 years before signing on properly, despite watching many boys come in and sign within weeks of being there, however, this taught me a valuable lesson that would be crucial going forward, ‘Just out-work them’ became a staple for my whole life, no excuses, just work harder.
To cut a very long story short I was in the academy system from that point onwards, I was released by Bolton at 10, signed for Huddersfield Town at 11, and they shut down their academy which led me to sign for Burnley at 12. This was my happiest time in football however was the most strenuous, as a kid balancing 6 days a week of training, finishing at 9:30 pm each night, home by 11, and awake for school by 7, missing full days for our weekly Thursday day release and half days for matches on Wednesdays, not to mention the countless tournaments that would have me away for days, it was hard to focus on anything school related, I knew what I wanted to do and I knew I could get there.
After a few more releases and picking myself up time after time, I made my first team debut for Halifax Town at 17 years old, it was truly a dream come true, but sadly this was short-lived, I ended up having a full rupture of my ACL, MCL and meniscus the next day in a game to make up some minutes for the week. This was truly heartbreaking, I from cloud 9 to rock bottom in a matter of hours, despite this, I didn't want to give in, I had my knee surgically repaired and dedicated my life to getting back healthy for a year, one of my greatest achievements in sport was not only returning from this injury physically, but mentally. Despite these efforts, luck was not on my side, as about 3 months into being back playing, I dislocated my other knee forcing me into another surgery. <br /><br /> As you can imagine it was a very hard pill to swallow, not only was it another surgery but some complications forced me into an extremely early retirement and left me stranded.
Now the purpose of this backstory is not for pity, but to show what makes me valuable today, I believe that I offer a different kind of employee than the standard university student. I have been perfecting my skills practically in Leadership, Teamwork, Dealing with pressure, Learning, Adaptability, Taking on advice, Taking on criticism without it being personal, Confidence, Conversing and articulating appropriately with ALL demographics and age ranges, i have much more to offer but the main thing I think stands out is the proof in my history that I am not only a hard-worker, but a consistent hard-worker who has set out goals and achieved them in a challenging field of work (fun fact, the odds of a boy playing academy football is 0.5% of boys his age, and the odds of that boy making his first team debut is 2% of the 0.5%) I believe this is proof of my ability to achieve goals in my field, and now my field is coding! I am not only excited to grow but expect to grow and improve each day, I do not aim to get a job in coding and scrape by each day, I intend to achieve greatness in anything I do and will strive to learn and improve at least 1% each day.
